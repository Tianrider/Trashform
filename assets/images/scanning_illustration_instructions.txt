SCANNING ILLUSTRATION SPECIFICATIONS

Please create and place an illustration image named "scanning_illustration.png" in this directory.
The image should depict hands holding a smartphone that is scanning a plastic bottle, similar to the one shown in the app design.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Format: PNG with transparency is good, but SVG would be better for scaling
2. Dimensions: At least 500x500px for PNG to look good on high-resolution devices
3. Style: Flat, modern illustration style with clean lines
4. Colors: Use the app's green theme (base color: #2E7D32) for elements like the phone
5. Composition: Center the hands holding the phone, with the bottle positioned below

If using SVG:
- Make sure all text is converted to paths
- Keep the file size reasonable (<100KB if possible)
- Test on different devices to ensure it scales well

If using PNG:
- Use transparency where appropriate
- Save in PNG-24 format with transparency
- Consider providing multiple resolutions (@2x, @3x) for better display on various devices

This file can be deleted once the illustration is created.
